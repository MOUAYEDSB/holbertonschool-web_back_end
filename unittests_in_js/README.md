# Unittests in JS ðŸ’»

## Description: ðŸ’¬

Unit testing in JavaScript is the practice of creating automated tests to examine individual units, often functions or methods, of a JavaScript application. These tests aim to verify the correct behavior of each unit under various conditions, helping to discover bugs early, enhancing code quality, and making it easier to refactor code safely. JavaScript offers a range of frameworks and libraries, such as Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine, to help with defining test cases, organizing tests, and mocking dependencies. Implementing this methodology is essential for developing robust and reliable applications, as it supports agile development practices by enabling quick and frequent test executions.

## What we should learn from this project: ðŸ“‘

- **How to use Mocha to write a test suite**

- **How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)**
- **How to present long test suites**
- **When and how to use spies**
- **When and how to use stubs**
- **What are hooks and when to use them**
- **Unit testing with Async functions**
- **How to write integration tests with a small Node server**

## Tasks ðŸ“š

To learn the concepts described above, follow the tasks below:

0. **Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library**

   Create a simple test using the Node.js built-in `assert` module.

1. **Combining descriptions**

   Practice using different descriptions and tags to better organize your test cases.

2. **Basic test using Chai assertion library**

   Rewrite the test cases from task 0 using Chai assertion library.

3. **Spies**

   Learn how to use Mocha and Sinon to create spies and monitor function calls.

4. **Stubs**

   Create a simple stub to replace a function with predefined behavior.

5. **Hooks**

   Implement and use hooks to manage test setup and teardown.

6. **Async tests with done**

   Learn how to test asynchronous functions using Mocha's `done` callback.

7. **Skip**

   Use the `skip` method to exclude a test case from running.

8. **Basic Integration testing**

   Write a test for an API endpoint using a small Node server.

9. **Regex integration testing**

   Test an API endpoint with dynamic data using regular expressions.

10. **Deep equality & Post integration testing**

    Test for deep equality and learn about post-integration testing.
