# Description: 💬
Async Comprehension in Python refers to the ability to use asynchronous operations within a comprehension construct. Comprehensions are concise ways to create lists, dictionaries, or other data structures in Python. With the introduction of asynchronous programming using the async and await keywords, Python also allows asynchronous operations to be combined with comprehensions
