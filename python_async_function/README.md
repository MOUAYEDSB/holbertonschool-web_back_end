# Description: 💬
Python's async is a programming approach that allows asynchronous execution of tasks without blocking the main program's flow. It leverages the async and await keywords to create asynchronous functions (coroutines), enabling efficient handling of I/O-bound operations and concurrent tasks. This enables better resource utilization and responsiveness in applications involving operations like network requests, database access, or file I/O. The asyncio library in Python facilitates the management of asynchronous code execution by providing tools to create, schedule, and coordinate asynchronous tasks.

# What we should learn from this project: 📑
- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

# Tasks: 📚
0. The basics of async
1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
2. Measure the runtime
3. Tasks
4. Tasks
