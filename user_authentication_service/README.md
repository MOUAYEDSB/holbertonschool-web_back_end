# User Authentication Service 💻

<img src="image/readme_pic.jpg" alt="Alt Text">

User authentication service is a security mechanism designed to verify the identity of users trying to access a network, system, or application. It ensures that only authorized individuals can gain entry by requiring them to present valid credentials, such as usernames and passwords, biometric data, or security tokens. This service plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data. It can be implemented through various methods, including single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and federated identity management, depending on the level of security required.
