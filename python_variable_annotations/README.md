<img src="/holbertonschool-web_back_end/python_variable_annotations/images/readme.png" alt="python-img-project ">
# Description: 💬
- Variable annotations in Python involve specifying the expected type of a variable using type hints. These hints provide information about the data type the variable should hold, enhancing code readability and assisting static analysis tools. Although variable annotations are optional, they aid in conveying intentions clearly and can be valuable for documentation and maintaining code quality.
# What we should learn from this project: 📑
- Type annotations in Python 3
- How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy
# Tasks: 📚
0. Basic annotations - add
1. Basic annotations - concat
2. Basic annotations - floor
3. Basic annotations - to string
4. Define variables
5. Complex types - list of floats
6. Complex types - mixed list
7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
8. Complex types - functions
9. Let's duck type an iterable object
